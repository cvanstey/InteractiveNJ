Conceived in 1936 as a cartoon ad, Elsie was so well received that Borden Company was forced to select a real bovine at the 1939 World’s Fair. In 1941, Elsie’s trailer was involved in an accident on Route 1 on the way to an appearance. She died of injuries and was buried on the farm. The gravesite, designated a “commemorative area,” has been arranged by Baker Residential Developer of Walker-Gordon Farm, Plainsboro Township, and Walker-Gordon Homeowners Association.\n\nIn 1897 Walker-Gordon purchased 180 acres of prime farmland in Plainsboro, New Jersey, a small village located in the center of the state. Walker-Gordon’s products exceeded all of the standards of health for that time. They marketed “Guaranteed Milk,” which later became known as “Certified Milk.” Many of the concepts and procedures developed by Walker-Gordon are considered standard practices on today’s dairy farms.\n\nIn 1929 the Borden Company purchased Walker-Gordon. In 1930 they invented the soon-to-be world-famous Rotolactor. Borden wanted to have a top-notch dairy exhibit at the 1939 New York World’s Fair, so they had built a Rotolactor: a giant, glass-enclosed turntable on which cows were milked by automated machines. The Rotolactor was a modern marvel. Cows entered the building and were washed and then loaded onto the carousel. Hoses were attached to their udders for milking. When the milking was completed, the cows exited, the stall was hosed off, and another group of cows climbed on board. The Rotolactor was very futuristic and a hit with fairgoers, but it was only used twice a day during milking and crowds were thin in between. Borden had to come up with an idea quickly to keep people interested in their exhibit. They decided that they needed a celebrity to promote Borden’s products and draw a crowd.\n\nSearching for a solution, Borden’s ad agency scanned a list of questions asked by visitors. They were amazed to find that six out of every ten asked, “Which cow is Elsie?” Elsie was an animal who existed only in a series of cartoon magazine ads for Borden. Could Elsie be the solution? The agency combed the Borden herd of 150 cows at the fair and quickly settled on a good-natured, big-eyed Jersey named “You’ll Do Lobelia.” She was rechristened Elsie and put on the Rotolactor between milkings. Thus, a celebrity was born. People lined up to see the famous cow with the daisy necklace. By the time the fair closed in 1940, “Elsie” had become its #1 attraction.\n\nAfter the fair, Elsie went on tour. She was the guest of honor at press dinners in swank New York clubs. She starred in an RKO feature, “Little Men,” in 1940 and made a series of cross-country appearances in her custom 18-wheeler (later dubbed the “Cowdillac”). But on April 16, 1941, while on her way to Shubert Alley in the theater district of New York City, her truck was hit from behind by another truck while stopped at a traffic light on Route 25 in Rahway, NJ. She suffered neck and spine injuries and was returned to her home at the Walker-Gordon Farm in Plainsboro.\n\nThe veterinarians determined that she could not be saved, so she was “put to sleep” and buried on the farm. A headstone was erected at the farm’s entrance, praising her as “one of the great Elsies of our time.” Borden quietly christened a new Elsie and the promotional juggernaut moved forward, unaffected.\n\nIn 1944 the Borden Company sold the dairy and the Jeffers family became the principal owners. From its small beginning, by 1945 Walker-Gordon had grown to be the world’s largest certified milk farm. They had over 1,500 cows producing more than 24,000 quarts of milk per day. It took 160 employees to run the operation. There were about 2,500 acres of land to grow the roughage feed for 1,650 milking cows, 520 dry cows, 650 young stock, and 22 bulls. Due to various financial reasons, by 1971 it had become unprofitable to continue as a dairy operation. So on June 18, 1971 the dairy operation of the Walker-Gordon Laboratory ceased. Walker-Gordon went on to raise beef cattle and to grow and sell general field crops. Years passed into decades, the Walker-Gordon Dairy Farm went out of business, and in June 1999 “Elsie’s” headstone was moved farther west on Plainsboro Road. A little gazebo was built next to it, ideal for wedding vows. A plaque was added to the site, praising Elsie as “a celebrated advertising trademark” and claiming that this was her burial site, even though it isn’t exactly (nor, for that matter, was the headstone’s former location). The true grave was lost under the landscape years ago.\n\nToday, on the property made famous by Walker-Gordon Laboratories, sits the new Walker-Gordon Farm. It is now a homeowners association comprised of 355 single-family homes. The gravesite of “You’ll Do Lobelia,” the first Elsie, remains as a historical landmark to this day.", "image": {"id": "edl9n8dv1bl16hnq", "w": 700, "h": 525, "tip_color": "#64746e", "avg_color": "#848380"}, "marker-color": "#005e38", "group": 2037553178, "url": "https://www.walkergordononline.com/", "title": "Elsie the Borden Cow\nWalker Gordon Farm (now a residential community off Plainsboro Road), Plainsboro, NJ 08536\n609-989-8500 (housing community)"}}, {"type": "Feature", "id": 1435353922, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.360495, 40.540185]}, "properties": {"description": "Metuchen’s Old Colonial Cemetery was established between 1715 and 1730 as the burying ground associated with the Presbyterian Church.

Of these, 59 are graves of Revolutionary War soldiers and 7 are “Patriots” who contributed to the cause.\n \nThe first Metuchen meetinghouse was an 8-sided building located near the southeast corner of the site. After it burned, a new building was constructed on the same site and then later enlarged in 1753. In 1777, George Washington referenced the Metuchen Meeting House in letters regarding skirmishes in the area. The Meetinghouse was expanded again in 1792, but the congregation continued to grow and in 1836 the new Presbyterian Church was built on the east side of Main Street and the original meetinghouse was demolished. That same year the railroad was laid through Metuchen and ran along on the northern edge of the cemetery. In 1887 the railroad bought the property along the northern edge of the cemetery as part of a track expansion project and the remains from that section were reinterred in the new Presbyterian Cemetery located on eastern side of Main Street.\n\nAs time passed and the cemetery was no longer in active use, its condition declined. Headstones were vandalized; weather and acid rain wore off the face of some of the stones. In 1974, the Presbyterian Church donated the cemetery to the Borough, with the hope that it would be better cared for. However, little was done until the 1990s when the Cemetery Committee of the Metuchen-Edison Historical Society was formed and raised money to remove old trees, install flagpoles, benches, a new staircase, and a fence. After a great deal of work done by the Society and numerous Eagle Scout projects, the cemetery is now more accessible, the site of the original meetinghouse is marked, and signage helps interpret the site to visitors.", "image": {"id": "9beeqdvcapitk2p4", "w": 700, "h": 525, "tip_color": "#716f70", "avg_color": "#82837c"}, "marker-color": "#005e38", "group": 2037553178, "url": "https://www.revolutionarywarnewjersey.com/", "title": "Old Colonial Cemetery\nMain Street at Woodbridge Ave., Main Street, Metuchen, NJ 08840\n732-632-8540 \n\nHOURS: Dawn to Dusk PARKING: On Street"}}, {"type": "Feature", "id": 2909077855, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.259587, 40.339757]}, "properties": {"description": "The Old Scots Burying Ground is also one of the sites of the Battle of Monmouth.

However, more recent research using ground-penetrating radar reported by the Old Tennent Church in 2001 has put the number of confirmed sites at about 122 graves with a possible 140 more unmarked; placing the number at about 262 total graves in the cemetery. In 1945, in an attempt to clean out the site of vegetation and overgrowth, a bulldozer was used on the property and as a result some headstones were dislodged and broken stones removed. The defining structure in the cemetery is a tall monument to Rev. John Boyd, created by the J&R Lamb Company. Built to commemorate the first recorded Presbyterian ordination of Rev.

The cemetery was established in 1757, and the oldest surviving monument is that of Aaron Burr, Sr., located in the Presidents’ Plot. The cosmopolitan character of the cemetery continues, and internment has never been restricted to church members and their families. John Witherspoon was the only clergyman and college president to sign the Declaration of Independence, and is buried in the cemetery. \n\nBecause so many prominent citizens are buried here, the cemetery was called the “Westminster Abbey of the United States” by John Frelinghuysen Hageman in his 1878 history entitled The History of Princeton and Its Institutions. In addition, it has been designated by the Delaware River Planning Commission as a historical site “well worth preservation.” The development of the cemetery is deeply rooted in the church, the university, and the larger community, which had been settled as Stony Brook in 1681, renamed Princeton in 1724, and incorporated by the state in 1813.\n\nPresident Grover Cleveland is buried in the cemetery. Richard Stockton, Sr. a signer of the Declaration of Independence and member of the Continental Congress, was known to have been buried in the Quaker Cemetery in 1781; however, the graves of both his son and grandson are in the Princeton Cemetery.\n\nThe oldest part of the cemetery, formerly known as the Old Graveyard, lies at the intersection of Wiggins and Witherspoon streets and includes the Presidents’ Plot. All but four deceased presidents of Princeton University are buried here. One can see some of the earliest European family names in the area: Bayard, Berrien, Leonard, Mershon, Skillman, Stockton, and Terhune. This original one-acre parcel of land had been acquired by the College of New Jersey (now Princeton) upon completion of Nassau Hall, still the university’s main building.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century the cemetery was enclosed by a low brick wall along Witherspoon Street and an old, dilapidated wooden fence around the rest of the perimeter. Within the second set of cemetery gates in the area known as the Witherspoon Jackson Community, is what was originally designated as the Colored Cemetery, established in 1807.

A typical East Jersey Deep Cottage, it has remained on its original site with few alterations to its original footprint, and remained in the ownership of one family, the descendants of Obadiah Ayers, for more than 180 years.\n \nThe Ayers family were some of the first European settlers of Woodbridge Township, arriving in 1669. Obadiah Ayers and his wife, Hannah Pike Ayers, daughter of one of the nine original associates of Woodbridge Township, John Pike, arrived from Massachusetts with Reverend John Woodbridge. Obadiah’s and Hannah’s son John is the first recorded landowner in what is now known as Metuchen and is referred to in a deed of 1695 as “John Ayers of Metuching.”\n \nA late 18th century map of the area refers to the house as one of the “Allen Houses”; Henry Allen’s will recorded in 1783, states that he purchased the lot and house in which he lived from his father-in-law, Jonathan Ayers. Upon the death of Henry’s wife, Phebe Ayers Allen, the house reverted to ownership by her cousin, Jacob Ayers. Both Henry Allen and Jacob Ayers were patriots who are recorded as having served in the Revolutionary War. A 1791 inventory of the household reflects its agricultural functions, listing tools, farm products stored in the barns, and numerous animals. Late 18th- and early 19th-century tavern licenses on file in the State Archives indicate it also served as a public house for several years. Local legend holds that Catherine Allen’s tavern was famous for its ginger cakes and ale.\nThroughout the 19th-century, the house remained in the family through inheritance and marriage, but in 1924 was sold to the Wales family. Letters written by the Wales children document the condition of the house at the time and its subsequent renovations, including the addition of a bedroom on the second floor over the kitchen. For a short time, Mrs. Wales ran a gift shop from a room on the western end of the house. In the early 1940s, the Kadison Family bought the house, and then in 1947, they sold it to Samuel and Louise King. As often happens with houses of great age, local legends about “ghosts” abound. In addition to the many stories that have appeared in the press, a chapter about the home’s “other” inhabitants was included in Hans Holzer’s “Ghosts” following a séance he conducted in the living room in 1960.\n\nAlthough Mr. King passed away in the mid-1960s, Mrs. King remained in the home and worked with local historian Marion Stone to have the house listed in the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places in 1985. In the late 1990s, Mrs. King passed away and the estate sold the house to the current owners.", "image": {"id": "vfitl0lexsv58p3s", "w": 4320, "h": 3240, "tip_color": "#acdef7", "avg_color": "#779bb5"}, "group": 949674499, "title": "Ayers Allen House\n16 Durham Avenue, Metuchen, NJ 08840\n\nPRIVATE RESIDENCE", "marker-symbol": "house"}}, {"type": "Feature", "id": 3618714862, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.657406, 40.350403]}, "properties": {"description": "Built in 1766 by Job Stockton, a prosperous tanner and cousin of Richard Stockton, signer of the Declaration of Independence, Bainbridge House is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Princeton and one of the area’s best-preserved examples of mid-Georgian architecture.

Although the home bears the name of one of its original owners, it was called home by many before him. It is believed to have been built as a manse for the first minister of the First Presbyterian Church, Archibald Riddell. The home, however, was not completed, as the minister’s wife did not like it much. It was later completed by the town and another minister by the name of Sheppard moved into the home in 1697. Later, a Revolutionary War soldier, Aaron Dunn, called the structure home. Another one-time resident was James Bloodgood, a local tanner who owned thirteen acres of property outside of the “Kirk Green.” It is thought that much of this property consisted of the area between Lewis Street and Ridgedale Avenue. The home contains many original features, including four fireplaces, and two sets of stairways to the second floor and the attic. Many of the doors are believed to be original to the home, fashioned in “Christian style” with a cross shape between the door panels and fastened with “H” and “L” hinges.

The village is located in Johnson Park, and is accessible by a one-way park road from Landing Lane, or by a two-way park road from River Road at Hoes Lane West. \n\nThe collection presently includes the following buildings: \n\nFarley Blacksmith Shop - The original 19th-century blacksmith shop was opened in 1851 on Burnet Street, New Brunswick by Cornelius Farley and operated by the Farley family until 1960. The shop was moved to the racetrack area of Johnson Park in 1961 to escape demolition, and then to East Jersey Old Towne Village in 1976.\n \nWilliamson Wheelwright Shop - This shop was built in the late 1700s on the Brunswick-Princeton Road (Route 27) near the Six Mile Run Dutch Reformed Church, now the Franklin Park section of Franklin Township. It was built by William Williamson, a church elder, and operated by the family until 1853. The shop continued in business under other owners until 1951. The building was moved to its current site in 1977.\n \nSix Mile Run House - This restored mid-1700s house built near the Six Mile Run church was occupied by various families until the 1970s. The location is about a mile south of the Six Mile Run stream crossing on the Brunswick-Princeton Road (Route 27). The church was originally built near the stream and kept its Six Mile Run name when it moved down the road. The house was moved to the village in 1979 and restored in 2001. The rear section was renovated to its 1760 appearance and the larger two-story front section to 1820. \n\nSmalley Town Schoolhouse - This c. 1803 one-room structure originally stood in Warren Township, Somerset County. It was used as a schoolhouse by the Rev. David D. Smalley III, who taught 40 pupils there in the 1870s and 1880s. The school closed in1884. It was reconstructed on-site in 1977. \n\nVanderveer House - In 1743 Jacobus Vanderveer, a second-generation Dutch settler in Somerset County, purchased land near the North Branch of the Raritan River in what was then the northern precinct of Somerset County and built this house. The land became part of Bedminster Township, established by royal charter in 1749 and incorporated in 1798. The house was moved to the village in 1975.\n \nChurch of the Three Mile Run - This is a replication of an early 18th-century Dutch Reformed Church that stood on the Princeton Road outside New Brunswick. The actual church building likely stood at the Dutch Reformed burial yard near the Three Mile Run crossing of the Princeton Road (now Route 27). The church closed in mid-century as parishioners moved to newer churches in nearby villages. The building itself is believed to have been destroyed by British troops during their occupation of New Brunswick in 1777. The burial yard in New Brunswick remains and is maintained by volunteers. It was the first church building in the upper Raritan Valley. \n\nJeremiah Dunn House - This reconstructed mid-18th-century farmhouse was originally built by Jeremiah Dunn, a descendant of early Europeans who had settled in Piscataway Township. The house stood on Stelton Road in the North Stelton section of Piscataway and remained in the Dunn family until the late 19th century. It was dismantled and moved to Johnson Park in 1974. \nPound - FitzRandolph House - This is a charming example of late 18th-century farmhouse-area architecture which was first occupied by Piscataway Quaker Elijah Pound, then later by David FitzRandolph and his family. The home was originally located in the Randolphville section of Piscataway and was donated and relocated to East Jersey Old Town in 1976.\n\nRunyon House - Benjamin Runyon built this house on Possumtown Road sometime between 1755 and 1780. His family, French Huguenots, emigrated to New Jersey in 1668, shortly after the English took over New Netherland. The house was moved to Johnson Park in 1978. \n\nNew Brunswick Barracks - This structure is a replica of a colonial building that once stood on George Street in New Brunswick and was destroyed by fire in 1796. Military barracks were constructed at five locations in New Jersey after 1758, but only the Trenton barracks remains. The other barracks were in Burlington, Perth Amboy, and Elizabeth.\n \nIndian Queen Tavern - This reconstructed New Brunswick colonial tavern stood near the Raritan River on Albany Street. It was built as a house c. 1740 and operated as a tavern from about 1760 until 1964. Its location on the main post road between Elizabeth and Trenton attracted many travelers, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin among them.", "image": {"id": "rev2n7mzhmkdpk75", "w": 700, "h": 525, "tip_color": "#9c8159", "avg_color": "#807869"}, "group": 949674499, "url": "https://www.middlesexcountynj.gov/", "title": "East Jersey Old  Town Village\n1050 River Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, at southern riverside extension of Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854 \nJohnson County Park artsandhistory@co.middlesex.nj.us 732-745-3030 \n\nSEASONAL HOURS: APRIL - NOVEMBER Wed. through Friday 10:00am – 4:00pm Saturday & Sunday 12:00 – 4:00 Thursday Until 8:00 pm June - August.

The beautiful inlaid oak and walnut floors, hand-carved balustrade and spindles of the staircase, and a carved sandstone fireplace add to the ambiance of this historic residence.\n\nHendrick (Visscher) Fisher Jr. was born in Germany in 1697 and emigrated with his family, by the way of Holland, to the colonies several years later. The family name, Visscher, was later anglicized to Fisher. In 1721, Hendrick Fisher became a member of the Dutch Reformed Church in New Brunswick, displaying great leadership and becoming a deacon under the Rev. Theodore Frelinghuysen.\n\nFisher was a faithful worker and leader in the church for 58 years. Artifacts from his church life can be viewed in the Museum of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Pieces of furniture from the Fisher estate, including a bench, table, cabinet, and chair can be seen in the entry sunroom of the Fisher Homestead.\n\nHendrick Fisher held the following political offices:\n\nJudge of the Court of Common Pleas\nMember of the Colonial Assembly for 30 years and for some time its powerful leader\nNew Jersey representative to the Continental Congress of 1765\nPresident of the Colonial Assembly\nMember of the Committee of Governors\nPresident of the First Provincial Congress of New Jersey, 1775\nPresident of the New Jersey Delegation to the Continental Congress\nOne of three New Jersey delegates to the Stamp Act Congress\n\nFisher was present for the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.

Today a plaque marking this historic event can be seen at 215 Main Street, Bound Brook.\n\nIn 1776 Lord Howe offered full pardon to those forfeiting their allegiance to the American cause, excluding Fisher and three other patriots. Fisher was branded an outlaw and “enemy of the Crown.”\n\nIn April 1777 the British raided the Fisher Homestead en route to New Brunswick, in hopes of capturing him. Not finding him at home, they plundered his barn and livestock, resulting in losses totaling $707.50, a substantial sum in those days. Fisher died before the conclusion of the Revolution, and his body rests in the family burial ground, in a special fenced section of St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cemetery.\n\nToday, the Fisher homestead is the property of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA and is located on the grounds of the St. Andrew Center.

Legend has it that the British directed cannon fire at the house from across the Raritan River during their pursuit of Washington and the Continental Army in late 1776, in the belief that hides hanging on a rope outside the building were American troops. Guest and his family are believed to have left New Brunswick at that time, allowing the house to be used by British soldiers during their occupation of the city.\n\nMajor General William Alexander, aka Lord Stirling, stayed at the house in July 1778 to open the court-martial of Major General Charles Lee, second-in-command of the Army, for disobedient actions during the Battle of Monmouth. Alexander presided over the trial’s opening session in New Brunswick at the Whitehall Hotel on Albany Street and at subsequent locations as the Army moved north. Lee was ultimately found guilty of some of the charges and resigned his commission.\n\nGuest’s son, Moses, a captain in the 2nd Middlesex militia, joined with regiment commander John Neilson in 1780 in the capture of British raider Major John Graves Simcoe outside the city.

Kilmer continued this practice as an adult, calling himself “Joyce Kilmer” in his work, military career, and writings.\n\nKilmer’s father, Frederick Kilmer, a chemist-pharmacist by training, joined the new Johnson & Johnson medical supplies firm in New Brunswick as its chief science officer in 1889, and the family moved across town to College Avenue to be close to the J&J plant.

Early surviving historic fabric includes random-width, tongue-and-grove flooring, baseboards, chair rails, door and window trim, and two fireplaces, one of which retains its mantel and adjacent four-door cupboard.  Despite the post-fire rebuilding, the Lane-Voorhees House remains one of the best-preserved examples of 18th-century brick domestic architecture in Somerset County.  The house was constructed by William Lane, a third-generation Dutch-American farmer. After the 1837 fire the interior of the house was rebuilt by Court G. Voorhees, who lived in the house until his death in 1847. \n\nLocal tradition connects the house with a condolence call paid by General George Washington to Mary Brokaw, the widow of Lieutenant John Brokaw, who was killed at the Battle of Germantown in October 1777.  General Washington was residing at the Wallace House in Somerville, his headquarters during the Middlebrook Cantonment.  Mrs. Brokaw resided at the house during her widowhood, perhaps as a housekeeper, and later married William Lane.

In 1729 he moved to Raritan Landing with his wife Johanna Gouverneur of Newark and became an active trader at Raritan Landing. He moved to this new house “on the mountain” in 1741 to escape the occasional flooding of the Raritan River. The family divided on the American Revolution, but the home remained unscathed by local skirmishes and British occupation of the Landing in 1776-77. Low died in 1777 and the house remained in family hands through the Revolution, sold first in 1795 to the Poole family. Later owners included George W. Metlar, Anna Voorhees, and Stephen Strong. \n\nThe Georgian-style manor home is built of New Jersey sandstone most likely quarried in Belleville, NJ and is one of the finest examples in the state.

It is the eldest of two buildings remaining from Raritan Landing, one of the nation’s first river port communities. Two 19th-century additions, built by owners Samuel Knapp (Greek Revival) and George Metlar (Victorian), enlarged the house, a key indication of the community’s transformation into a New Brunswick suburb. Its local moniker “the Metlar \n\nIn 1972 it was listed in the State and National Registers of Historic Sites by mid-20th century owner, Rutgers professor John Newton. In the late 1970s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation purchased the historic site; their plans to demolish and subsequently construct a new Route 18 Interchange caused a citizen outcry. The imminent destruction propelled Piscataway Township, in union with The Fellowship for Metlar House (the museum’s foundation), to lease the site from the state for use as the township’s official historical and cultural museum. The house is considered one of the best examples of a New Jersey vernacular-style farmhouse - each section reflects the time in which it was constructed. In 1994, a name change to The Metlar-Bodine House Museum highlights the first and last historical owners.\n\nIn 2003, a fire severely damaged the historic site and its collection of more than 1000 artifacts, all with area provenance. Today, after a 13-year, $2.5 million building restoration/collection conservation project, the Metlar-Bodine House is considered a regional museum. Located in one of the nation’s busiest transportation corridors, the site and its remarkable collection of Central NJ artifacts are interpreted with the theme “From Indian Trail to Interstate,” explaining how, throughout its notable history, modes of travel (the Raritan River, the Minisink Trail, the Great Road Up Raritan, the D&R Canal, trolley routes, area highways) have impacted the social and economic growth of Piscataway. \n\nOne of the most compelling of these impacts happened in July 1778. Following the Battle of Monmouth, George Washington and 11,000 patriots were resting along the Raritan. They were on their way to New York and this was the popular route. The General’s headquarters was at Ross Hall in Piscataway. It was at this place and time that Washington ordered what may be considered the first organized national expression of July 4th as Independence Day. The mansion was demolished in 1960, but a parlor wall that had borne witness to the celebration survived. A piece of the building’s 18th-century interior, architecturally stunning with raised panels and shell cupboards, a patriotic relic, and without question an American treasure, the Ross Hall Wall will be installed in a new addition to the museum.", "image": {"id": "v79uobcn5dvsfwkg", "w": 700, "h": 525, "tip_color": "#575a3c", "avg_color": "#666864"}, "group": 949674499, "url": "http://www.metlarbodinehousemuseum.org", "title": "Metlar-Bodine House Museum\n1281 River Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854  732-463-8363\n\nTOURS: Thursdays: 12:30pm–4:00pm; Saturday tours and special event/program hours can be found at http://www.metlarbodinehousemuseum.org Select Programs/Events then select Box Calendar or follow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/MetlarBodineHouseMuseum DIRECTIONS: From River Road, turn onto Hillcrest Drive.

The house and property were purchased by 1735 by John Berrien, who later served as Somerset County Judge, Trustee for the College of New Jersey (present-day Princeton University), New Jersey Supreme Court Justice and Colony Assemblyman. He greatly enlarged the house for his growing family in the 1760s and gradually added land to total over 360 acres, making it a substantial farm appropriate for a prosperous, well-established man. \n\nIn June of 1783, a small number of Pennsylvania troops of the Continental Army went into revolt and marched upon Philadelphia. Congress removed themselves to Princeton, New Jersey, after being assured of New Jersey’s protection. In late July, Congress requested the General’s presence in Princeton. Washington was in Newburgh, New York, near West Point with the remains of the standing army. Washington accepted in August. When accommodations were sought for Washington and his retinue, the only suitable home left sat four miles away and belonged to the widow of John Berrien. Mrs. Margaret Berrien (who was living in a townhome in Princeton and had Rockingham up for sale) agreed to rent Rockingham and furnishings to Congress for the General’s use on a monthly basis. On August 23rd of 1783, General Washington, accompanied by his wife, three aides-de-camp, a small guard of two to three dozen soldiers including dragoons (who served as his personal guard), and “domestics” (servants and slaves), took up residence. \n\nThe General stayed at Rockingham until early November. It must have been a pleasant stay with Rockingham’s varied orchards and spacious grounds. Mrs. Washington returned to Mount Vernon in early October. General Washington entertained frequently including Congressmen such as James Madison and Elias Boudinot, military personnel such as General Benjamin Lincoln, Revolutionaries Robert Morris (“Financier of the Revolution”) and Thomas Paine, and local acquaintances such as Annis Stockton (widow of Declaration of Independence signer, Richard Stockton) and the Van Hornes. He hosted at least one party with nearly two hundred guests in early September. He, as well as Martha, also sat for two portraits at Rockingham. \n\nAfter Congress issued a proclamation for the discharge of the army to begin November 4, Washington wrote his Farewell Orders to the Armies of the United States, giving thanks and praise to his troops and announcing his retirement from military service (and relinquishment of all power which could have made him king). He then sent this document out on October 30 to be read to the army at West Point on November 2 and published in Philadelphia newspapers thereafter. On October 31, Washington and Congress received word that the Treaty of Paris had been signed, formally ending the Revolutionary War. On November 10, Washington left the farmstead and returned to New York to oversee the disbandment of the army and to eventually re-enter New York City after the evacuation of British troops in early December. After that, his final journey home to Mount Vernon included the formal resignation of his commission to Congress in Annapolis (where they had gone for the winter in early November) and concluded with what he believed would be his final retirement to private life.", "image": {"id": "gapqpt9dbc0lcrji", "w": 700, "h": 525, "tip_color": "#69744d", "avg_color": "#74776d"}, "group": 949674499, "url": "https://www.rockingham.net/", "title": "Rockingham Historic Site\n\n84 Laurel Avenue/ Route 603\nKingston, NJ 08528\nrockingham1783@yahoo.com\n609-683-7132 \n\nHOURS: Wed.-Sat. at 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. 1:00, 2:00 & 3:00 p.m.; Sun. at 1:00, 2:00 & 3:00 p.m. PARKING: Lot", "marker-symbol": "house"}}, {"type": "Feature", "id": 4072737150, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.638732, 40.400628]}, "properties": {"description": "The town’s history dates to a land purchase in 1701 with visits from George Washington and the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.

Michael’s son, Derrick, who was born in the house in 1699, inherited the property after his father’s death.\n\nThe house served as headquarters for Quartermaster Nathanael Greene during the Second Middlebrook Encampment in 1778–79. Derrick offered his property for use by the Continental Army, and portions of the Pennsylvania troops encamped on his fields.\n\nWhile in residence here, General Greene wrote a letter to Jeremiah Wadsworth describing “a pretty little frisk” held in the house on March 17, 1779. Throughout the course of the evening, General Washington danced with Mrs. Greene “upwards of three hours without seting [sic] down.” In appreciation of the Van Veghtens’ hospitality, the Greenes, upon leaving the house, presented Mrs. Van Veghten with a mahogany tea table, which is in the possession of a family descendant.\n\nAfter Derrick Van Veghten’s death in 1781, the house passed through several families.

Between 1775 and 1776, Wallace purchased an additional 12 acres of land and built the eight-room Georgian-style mansion adjoining part of the existing farmhouse. He called the estate “Hope Farm.” Wallace intended the property to be his place of retirement. In the winter of 1778, the Continental Army camped at Middlebrook in the Watchung Mountains, three miles from Hope Farm. Jacob Hardenbergh helped ease tensions between the army and local residents who, although supportive of independence, were greatly inconvenienced by the troops’ presence.\n\nHardenbergh, student and successor of the late Rev. John Frelinghuysen at the Old Dutch Parsonage, was politically and socially active before, during, and after the Revolution. In 1766, Hardenbergh drafted, circulated, and submitted a petition to the Royal Government to establish a new “classical and divinity” school in the Colony of New Jersey. As a result of his efforts, Queen’s College (now Rutgers University) was chartered that same year. In 1785, Jacob Hardenbergh became the first president of Queen’s College. He also played an important role during the American Revolution, serving in New Jersey’s Provincial Congress. In 1781, Jacob Hardenbergh left Somerville to take a position in New York.\n\nIn late 1778, John Wallace was asked to share his home with Washington and his staff. The Wallace House became Washington’s headquarters for six months. When the General returned to the house in February 1779, after spending six weeks in Philadelphia attending Congress, his wife Martha, his aides, and his servants came with him. Here Washington and his staff planned the 1779 campaign against the Iroquois League (Sullivan’s Campaign). Washington left on June 3, 1779, paying Wallace $1,000 for the use of his house and furniture.\n\nWallace occupied the house with his wife Mary, his mother-in-law Mary Maddox, his youngest son William, and their slaves. Two older children, Joshua and Anne, lived nearby with their families.\n\nIn 1783, John Wallace and Mary Maddox died. Mary Wallace died the following year. William Wallace, at the age of 21, became the heir to Hope Farm. He lived there until his death in 1796 at age 33. His wife Sarah predeceased him, and their three orphaned children went to live with their uncle Joshua Wallace in Burlington, New Jersey. Joshua sold Hope Farm to Dickinson Miller in 1801, after the house had been vacant for five years.\n\nThe Wallace House became a museum in 1897 thanks to the Revolutionary Memorial Society.\n\nThe Old Dutch Parsonage was constructed in 1751 with funds from three Dutch Reformed Church congregations of the Raritan Valley. This 2½-story brick Georgian building was first occupied by the Rev. John Frelinghuysen and his family. While Frelinghuysen served the three congregations, he also tutored several young men in his home, preparing them for the seminary. John Frelinghuysen died in 1754, leaving behind his wife Dinah and their two children, Frederick and Eva. (Dinah later married Jacob Hardenbergh, one of her husband’s students.)\n\nThe Dutch Parsonage remained a pastor’s residence until 1810, when the church sold the building to Dr. Peter Stryker, a prominent local physician. In 1836, Stryker sold the house to the Doughty family.\n\nThe Doughtys owned the house until 1907, when they sold it to the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The railroad purchased the property to make improvements to the railroad right-of-way and slated the house for demolition. Public outcry and the intervention of the Frelinghuysen family led to the preservation of the Parsonage in 1913. It was moved from the foot of South Doughty Avenue to its present location in 1913. The State of New Jersey acquired the property in 1947.\n\nToday, the Wallace House and Old Dutch Parsonage Association continues this legacy of citizen involvement.

Church records indicate that the head carpenter was a “Mr. Wright” and that Reverend Alfred Goldsborough served as the first rector. \n\nCompleted in the summer of 1869, St. Luke’s Episcopal Church was built in the Carpenter Gothic (or Rural Gothic) style which became popular in the 1860s, in part due to the increased affordability of steam-powered woodworking and architectural tools that made jig sawn bargeboard a less costly, yet still attractive, alternative to stone. Based on its architectural style and date of construction, St. Luke’s has often been attributed to the architect Richard Upjohn (1802-1878). Although no firm connection to Upjohn himself has been established, its design clearly originated from his publications such as “A Book of Plans for Churches and Parsonages.” The Metuchen congregation’s budgetary concerns may have also led to the selection of an Upjohn design, as according to his 1852 book, only $3000 was needed to build one of his “cheap but still substantial buildings.” Therefore, the $4000 raised by the building committee would have been sufficient for one of these designs, if not the originally hoped for stone edifice with flying buttresses. \n\nThe longtime editor of Harper’s Weekly, Henry Mills Alden, was a founding member of the church and Poet Joyce Kilmer and New Jersey Governor George Silzer were both married here. In 1900, the cast iron water fountain, known locally as the “Horse Trough,” was installed in the triangle park adjacent to the church by the Woodwild Park Association in cooperation with the Middlesex Water Company.

While the parish was organized in 1756, Anglican services were conducted here prior to 1704. Missionaries were sent from England to New Jersey by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (S.P.G.). In the mid-18th century, c. 1750, thirty families around the village of Spotswood decided to establish a parish of their own. A missionary report, dated 1758, described a “handsome wooden church in a small village called Spotswood.” The first recorded vestry minutes were dated August 1761.\n\nIn 1765 S.P.G. united Freehold and Spotswood St. Peter’s churches into a new missionary district. Three years later S.P.G. gave the parish an altar book, dated 1767, and a Book of Common Prayer, dated 1764. These valuable items are in a display case at the rear of the church. A royal charter was granted by George III in 1773.\n\nSt. Peter’s was closed during the Revolutionary War and reopened in 1782. Due to limited finances and a shortage of clergy, priests served multiple congregations.\n\nIn 1848 the vestry learned that the original church building was unsafe. A new church was built and consecrated in 1854. The rectory was built in 1872 and the parish hall in 1888. The latter was expanded in 1955.\n\nExtensive alterations were carried out in 1896. The chancel was deepened by seven feet, enlarged on the south side for the organ chamber, and enlarged on the north side for a baptistery, and a basement was dug for a steam heater. New pews and carpet were installed, as well as stained-glass windows. The chancel window is a DeVoe family memorial, and the baptistery window is a Rapoyle family memorial. When the church reopened, it had its first vested choir of men and boys. In 1920, to honor WWI soldiers, the townspeople donated an altar that is now used in the Children’s Chapel. The brick wall and lynch gate were given as memorials in 1928. This was a very difficult year for St. Peter’s. On Good Friday a squirrel ate through wiring above the altar, causing a fire that necessitated repairs costing $10,000. After finishing the repairs, Arthur and Herman Lettau placed a sealed bottle, containing photos and a note, in the cross on the top of the steeple. The bottle was opened at a community service in 1992.\n\nThe Depression caused financial problems, and the vestry was forced to seek assistance. As a result, St. Peter’s become an assisted parish. In 1949 it was restored to full-parish status. In 1990 the organ chamber was changed to a baptistery, which created room for three additional rows of pews. Stained-glass windows and the new organ chamber were given as memorials. A dedication was held on Pentecost 1992.\n\nIn 1991 a restoration committee was formed for the purpose of restoring the church. The restoration included a major rebuilding of the bell tower, a new roof, new steeple, reinforced floors, new furnace and air conditioner, and historic refinishing of the exterior. Many people gave money, time, and talent to help raise needed funds. There were fundraising projects of every description, and all yard work was done by volunteers. One of our parishioners served as project manager. With great jubilation the steeple was replaced in 1995. A rededication service was held on October 16, 1996.\n\nIn recent years, the parking lot has been enlarged and a new garage added. The rectory was converted into offices and much-needed classrooms. Work in the cemetery has included retaining-wall restoration, grave identification, charting, and repair and resetting of old stones.\n\nSt. Peter’s has always been admired for its natural beauty.

The channel was dug just above the dam, in the present-day Bradley Gardens section of Bridgewater along the Old York Road. It ran nearly parallel to the river for three miles to Raritan.\n\nThe building of the canal stimulated manufacturing enterprises, among them the James Screw Company, which erected a stone building on the bank of the canal and manufactured wooden screws. In 1845 the Rope and Bagging Company set up operations to make rope, bagging, and duck, a durable cotton fabric. The company failed after four or five years, but its building was soon occupied by another firm, the American Gutta Percha Company, which manufactured gutta percha, a tough, latex-based substance, for a few years before it, too, failed.\n\nIn the 1840s, many mills used the power of the canal, grinding plaster, corn, oats, rye, and flaxseed. A paper mill and the Woods Shingle-Machine Company were also established. Most of these factories diverted the water of the canal through raceways into their own overshot or breast wheels. The water was then recycled into the Raritan River.\n\nOne of the most successful enterprises on the Raritan Power Canal was the Kenyon Machine Shop. Founded at Belvidere, New Jersey, Kenyon moved to Raritan in the 1840s. In the beginning, only millwright machinery and waterwheels were made; later the company turned to producing agricultural machinery, and it continues in operation today, although at a different location.\n\nIn his report on water supply and water power of New Jersey, Cornelius Vermeule notes: “At Raritan we estimate 19.2 horse-power improved at the Water Power Company’s plant. This operation consists of a crib dam 240 feet long by 4 feet high, and a raceway 3 miles long built about 1840. The fall is about 15 feet. The rental is somewhat indefinite, but seems to approximate $28 per horsepower per annum.”\n\nIn 1864, the Somerville Water-Power’s property was sold, and the firm reorganized under the name of the Raritan Water Power Company. Under this new management, the head gates, dam, and raceway were rebuilt. These improvements attracted larger industries, notably the Raritan Woolen Mills, perhaps the best example of a successful industry spawned by the Raritan Power Canal. In 1869, the Einstein Brothers of New York recruited J. Harper Smith to come to Raritan and take charge of the n ew mill they were building for the manufacture of heavy woolen goods and coatings. Over the years, under Smith’s direction, the Raritan Woolen Mills grew from 25 looms to 215. Smith also supervised a second mill, called Somerset Manufacturing; it had 125 looms turning out cashmere.\n\nAs the canal entered Raritan Borough, it passed under the Nevius Street Bridge. At this point, the main canal continued eastward to the basin and the Raritan River, while some of the water was diverted into a tailrace that paralleled the main waterway. Flowing behind the last few buildings, the canal completed its three-mile journey and emptied into the Raritan River.\n\nToday, the last few hundred yards of the main canal have been filled in to form a town park and an industrial zone. A spillway at the end of the watered section allows the overflow to return to the river. The canal park is home to the statue of John Basilone, Raritan’s World War II hero. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1942; Basilone then volunteered to serve again, and he was killed in action on Iwo Jima in 1945.\n\nThe Hibernia Mine Railroad Bridge, constructed in 1879, is the oldest surviving metal truss bridge in Somerset County. It is a five-panel half-hip Pratt thru-truss bridge with wrought iron Phoenix columns. It is second oldest Phoenix-column bridge in the state and the only one built as a railroad bridge. It was built by Clark, Reeves and Company, as a rail-carrying bridge that was located on the Hibernia Mine Railroad in Morris County, New Jersey. In 1894 the bridge was moved to Mill Lane, Hillsborough Township, Somerset County to carry vehicular traffic as part of a grade-crossing elimination project by the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The restored bridge was moved to its present location over the Raritan Power Canal in 2007 by Somerset County.\n\nThough the Raritan Power Canal is no longer used by industry, it serves the public as a recreation area. Somerset County’s Duke Island Park is encircled by the canal and the river. The canal path (never a towpath) is a boon for hiking, bird watching, or just walking a dog. The canal path is also part of Somerset County’s Raritan River Greenway. Once an industrial centerpiece, the Raritan Power Canal now lives on as a tranquil greenway, serving the people of Central New Jersey.", "marker-color": "#444444", "group": 2377855814, "title": "Raritan Power Canal\nSouth side of Old York Road, South of Old York Road / Somerset Street, Bridgewater and Raritan Borough, NJ", "marker-symbol": "industry"}}, {"type": "Feature", "id": 1690944556, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.912754, 40.63617]}, "properties": {"description": "Through its 12 buildings, its exhibitions—both permanent and rotating—of its collection of 40,000 artifacts, and its ongoing educational/outreach programs, the Red Mill Museum Village seeks to preserve, maintain, and present to the public the social, agricultural, and industrial heritage of Hunterdon County and its surrounding area.\n\nThe museum’s main building, the iconic Red Mill, was built ca. 1810 by Ralph Hunt to process wool. Its next owners diversified products processed at the mill and opened a dry goods establishment which carried everything from china to sheet iron. In the 1830s, a new owner ceased wool production and refitted the mill for grist. In the 1840s, the site was split into a mill and quarry and continued in operation under various owners. In 1892, the Clinton Illuminating and Water Co. was established on the mill’s second floor and provided electricity for Clinton’s street lamps. In succeeding years the mill produced a wide variety of items, and was known at times as the “Black Mill” and then the “White Mill.” In 1928, it was sold to the Clinton Water Supply Company and ceased operations.

The original section of the home dates to circa 1750. General John Frelinghuysen was an attorney who served as a Brigadier General during the War of 1812 and was later the Surrogate of Somerset County. Restoration funds from the New Jersey Historic Trust and the Somerset County Historic Preservation Grant Program are restoring the home to its original grandeur.\n\nThe land upon which the house stands is a section of a large tract of land purchased by Dutch settlers in 1683 from a Native American tribe for a paltry sum. Cornelius Middaugh was one of the earliest owners of the Frelinghuysen property, and it is believed that he may have constructed what is now the west wing of the house. Built in the early 1700s, the west wing is identified as the oldest section of the house and is presumed to have been used as a tavern, as well as a public meeting hall and jail for the then-governing Township of Bridgewater. The solid, unfinished style of this low structure reflects the thrifty nature of the early Dutch settlers who utilized the home in its totality. The small wooden structure faces north to what was known as Old York Road, once a wilderness route that grew into a major artery connecting New York and Philadelphia. Frederick Frelinghuysen, or perhaps a previous owner, may have been responsible for constructing the first brick story adjacent to the clapboard frame sometime before 1780. This section of the house is dated with more confidence as the building material, glazed headers from Holland, was a popular feature used by affluent homeowners between 1740 and 1780. By 1810, during John Frelinghuysen’s tenure, the second brick story had been added and the house was given its finished Federal style.

Shortly before midnight, the first of a large British contingent of almost 4,000 soldiers and 10 pieces of artillery moved out of New Brunswick. They were followed by other British and Hessian elements. Led by General Cornwallis and moving in four separate columns, the army silently marched along the country lanes of Middlesex and Somerset counties toward the unsuspecting Americans.\n\nThe American troops (two Pennsylvania regiments and one artillery company), who numbered approximately 500, were commanded by General Benjamin Lincoln. Lincoln’s headquarters were at the Philip Van Horne House in Bridgewater. Also stationed there was the American artillery battery of three cannon. The American infantry was positioned in Bound Brook near a small redoubt (called the Half Moon Battery) that had been constructed to defend the stone arch bridge across the Green Brook and the Queens Bridge across the Raritan River.\n\nThe British attack commenced with a force of Hessian Jägers attacking across the stone bridge over the Green Brook. This attacking force was held in check for a short time by the American troops in the redoubt but soon another British column attacked across the Queens Bridge and the Americans were forced to rapidly retreat. At the Van Horne house, the British line of infantry and dragoons swept forward under American artillery fire, and after killing some of the gun crews, captured the cannon around the house. The sudden attack was carried out so well that General Lincoln was forced to flee from his headquarters to avoid capture.\n\nThe British victory was a hollow one. Because the four columns had not been able to coordinate, the attack was largely made piecemeal and failed to fully surround the town before the Americans could react. Instead of capturing an expected 1,000 prisoners and inflicting a major blow to Washington’s army, the British had just a handful of prisoners and an impressive but rather useless triumph. Most of the American soldiers and their general had escaped to defenses atop the mountain and still blocked the strategic passes across the Watchungs. Any possible intention to advance further had to be abandoned. The victorious British and Hessians turned to pillaging the town.

He enlarged his holdings until the estate encompassed over 2,200 acres. J.B. Duke, for whom Duke University is named, had acquired his wealth in the tobacco and hydropower industries and used this fortune to convert Duke Farms into the showplace of New Jersey.\n\nWater was one of Duke’s passions. He pumped and filtered water from the Raritan River via the Raritan Power Canal to create a chain of lakes covering 75 acres. Streams were turned into new channels, flowing through grassy banks, lined with shrubs and flowers. Attractive stone bridges spanned rivers and brooks. Thirty-five fountains were built throughout the estate; one was an exact copy of a fountain in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\nBy the time he died in 1925, J. B. Duke had transformed his farmland and woodlots into an extraordinary landscape. He excavated nine lakes, constructed some forty-five buildings, and built nearly 2½ miles of stone walls and more than 18 miles of roadway. He also populated his park with countless pieces of sculpture.\n\nDuke engaged in at least three known building campaigns, employed hundreds of laborers, and utilized the latest technologies in excavation, construction, water filtration, and agriculture in pursuit of his vision. Much of the landscape that Duke created between 1893 and 1925 is still clearly evident at Duke Farms, a testament to his ingenuity, resourcefulness, and determination, as well as his bold vision and tremendous resources.\n\nJ. B. Duke died when his daughter Doris was twelve years old. She inherited control of the estate and continued to enhance the property when she reached her majority. Doris Duke adapted her father’s greenhouses to create display gardens that she opened to the public in 1964. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she purchased small 19th-century farms along the western boundary of the estate, which represent the rapidly vanishing agricultural landscape that once characterized central New Jersey. When she died in 1993, Doris Duke expressed in her will that Duke Farms serve as a haven for native flora and fauna and be used to drive positive change on issues concerning the health and protection of the environment.\n\nThe Duke Farms Foundation was created in 1998 to own and operate the property. Today, the property is being transformed into a regional center for environmental stewardship with many programs available for the public.

A second lock was constructed in 1866 to accommodate increased shipping through the canal after the Civil War.

The park is considered part of the national City Beautiful Movement that integrated city planning, open space preservation, and park design.  Green Brook Park was designed by the nation’s leading landscape architectural firm, Olmstead Brothers Landscape Architects, of Brookline, Massachusetts. The last section of the park, a 40-acre extension east of West End Avenue, was designed by local landscape architects Ralph Porter and Evert J. Rebell. Pedestrian paths lead users of the park through a series of well-designed spaces, enabling them to experience the natural surroundings on an intimate scale. The park includes landscaped terraces and water gardens, connected through the use of curvilinear strolling paths. In addition, the park as originally designed, contained a bowling green, children’s playground, wading pool-skating pond, baseball, football, and soccer fields. The 14-acre section of the park located in North Plainfield was secured by the City of Plainfield through a lease agreement with the Borough of North Plainfield in 1923. During the American Revolution the park was the site of the militia post known as the Blue Hills Fort. The site is listed in the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places. Cornelius Low, the home’s namesake, was the son of a wealthy New York merchant family of Dutch ancestry. In 1729 he moved to Raritan Landing with his wife Johanna Gouverneur of Newark and became an active trader at Raritan Landing. He moved to this new house “on the mountain” in 1741 to escape the occasional flooding of the Raritan River. The family divided on the American Revolution, but the home remained unscathed by local skirmishes and British occupation of the Landing in 1776-77. Low died in 1777 and the house remained in family hands through the Revolution, sold first in 1795 to the Poole family. Later owners included George W.

Natirar presents a unique opportunity to preserve and interpret many aspects of the area’s rich architectural, cultural, historic, and archaeological heritage. The property is open for walking and summer concerts.\n\nIn 1905 Walter Graeme Ladd and his wife Catherine (“Kate”) Everit Macy Ladd began to acquire land in what are now Peapack & Gladstone, Far Hills, and Bedminster. Eventually, the Ladds created one of the largest estates in the area, encompassing some 1,000 acres stretching from what is now Route 206 on the west, across the North Branch of the Raritan River on the east, and from Highland Avenue in Peapack on the north, to what is now Route 202 on the south. They named their estate “Natirar,” which is Raritan spelled backwards, because that river meanders for two miles across the property.\n\nThe Ladds’ brick forty-room Tudor-style mansion with limestone trim and slate roof, extensive oak paneling, and molded plaster ceilings, was completed in 1912. The main residence, several of the principal outbuildings, and the overall layout and landscape of the estate were designed by Guy Lowell, a Boston-born architect who is most famous for his design the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the New York County Court House on Foley Square in Manhattan.\n\nBeginning in 1908, Mrs. Ladd provided a convalescent facility on the Natirar estate, originally at “Maple Cottage,” a large residence that once stood along Peapack Road where “deserving gentlewomen who are compelled to depend upon their own exertions for sup- port shall be entertained, without charge, for periods of time while convalescing from illness, recuperating from impaired health, or otherwise in need of rest.”\n\nFollowing Mrs. Ladd’s death, title to Natirar was conveyed to the Kate Macy Ladd Fund and the convalescent facility was relocated from “Maple Cottage” to the renovated main residence, where it operated until 1983, the fiftieth anniversary of Walter Ladd’s death. That year, in accordance with the provisions of his will, the property was sold to Hassan II, the king of Morocco. He died in 1999 and his son, Mohammed VI, inherited Natirar.

The British attack, known as the Battle of Short Hills, was unsuccessful, as Lord Stirling mounted a ferocious defense, convincing the enemy that further advances were not justified.\n\nOne of the oldest state parks in New Jersey, Washington Rock was originally purchased in 1913 to commemorate the historical events of 1777.

According to the Recollections of Mrs. Phoebe Martin, “Samuel Compton and other farmers decided to build a school house… all the farmers came in and worked three or four days as convenient to build it… Benjamin Thornall, a carpenter, gave three days’ work on the building.” In 1842 the school was repaired and renovated with Greek Revival embellishments such as the cornice and cupola and the symmetrical 5-bay façade was created by a thirty-five-foot extension to accommodate a new room intended for use by the community. When the addition was built to the schoolhouse it was turned around to face the west and the end toward the street was used as a prayer meetinghouse. In 1873, a larger and newer Franklin School was built further south on Middlesex Avenue to accommodate the growing number of students in Metuchen and the “old” school house was retired from school service but continued to be used as a meetinghouse, library, and for other such needs as arose in the community. Eventually it became a private home for the Markey family, and their cobblers shop was run from a small building located on the northwest side of the property, adjacent to Middlesex Avenue. \n\nOn November 17, 1906, a recently formed civic society, the Borough Improvement League (B.I.L.), met to discuss “plans for preserving the Old Academy building.” The schoolhouse, which many residents had attended and remembered with fondness, was by then in extremely poor condition and the B.I.L. purchased the building for $800. Repair work included removing the partition built in 1842, re-bracing the roof, removing the plaster ceiling, adding a raised platform and small kitchen and dressing room, creating an inglenook, and adding a fireplace on the north side of the building. \n\nDuring the First World War, the building was opened to soldiers stationed at Raritan Arsenal for recreational purposes. A plaque, presented to the club on June 5, 1921 and located on the north side of building, commemorates the League’s contributions to the war effort.

The New Jersey Historic Bridge Survey calls it a rare surviving example of the double-intersection Pratt truss, whereby additional diagonal members extend across two panels of the normal Pratt truss. The bridge is also representative of the use of wrought iron in the relatively limited period of iron bridge construction before the dominance of steel. The authors of the bridge survey state, “metal trusses like the Nevius Bridge represent a noteworthy period of economic and industrial development in the country’s history, and played a prominent part in the advance of a reliable network of overland transportation.” The county hired two local masons, William W. Smith and Richard Farrier, to construct the stone abutments and center pier.

A rail line from the Hudson River at Jersey City, constructed by the 1832-chartered New Jersey Railroad (NJRR), reached New Brunswick in November. Rivalry with the Camden & Amboy Railroad, owners of the canal, stopped the line’s extension for two years, until construction of a jointly owned line to Trenton in 1839. The railroads merged as the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company in 1867.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad entered the picture in 1871, with a 999-year lease on the United New Jersey Railroad and the D&R Canal Company.\n\nInitial rail service through New Brunswick was at ground level, with a lift bridge on the crossing of the canal to allow boat traffic. The railroad depot was located next to the canal, at George and Somerset streets.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad built the present fixed high-level arched bridge across the Raritan River and the canal in 1902-3 (limiting boat height on the canal to fifty feet) and elevated its rail line for part of the distance through New Brunswick in 1903-4. The new structures and accompanying three-story railroad station were designed by William H. Brown, the Pennsylvania’s chief engineer. The style of the bridge and elevated stone retaining walls is Richardsonian Romanesque, reminiscent of the bridges and aqueducts of ancient Rome. The brick station, with its third-floor dormers, was built in late Georgian Revival style, adopted by the railroad for use in medium-sized cities. The station is the only one of this design remaining on the line in New Jersey. A similar station in Elizabeth was removed and replaced about thirty years ago.\n\nAlthough the general structure of the 1904 New Brunswick station remains, a fire in 1980 resulted in extensive renovation of its interior, and new track-level canopies were installed at about the same time. Brick elevator towers allowing handicapped access to the platforms were installed later in the 1980s. Current plans call for construction of a third elevator tower on the Easton Avenue side of the station to provide access to the two floors of the station, as well as the New York-bound platform and extension of the Trenton-bound platform across Easton Avenue to a stairwell access point on French Street.\nThe rail line through New Brunswick is part of Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor passenger service between Boston and Washington.\n\nThe station is listed in the State and National Registers of Historic Places. The entire Amtrak rail line through New Brunswick, from New York to Philadelphia, has been found eligible by the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for inclusion in the State and National Registers for Historic Places.

In 1955 its name (generally designated as N.J.C.) was changed to Douglass College, honoring its founder and first dean. The college was again reorganized in 2006, merging some of its holdings in a new Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences comprising all campuses in New Brunswick and Piscataway. A smaller Douglass Residential College — open to all Rutgers women in the New Brunswick-Piscataway area wishing to focus on student engagement and empowerment concerns as part of their overall curriculum was retained.\n\nCollege Hall, 125 George Street, is listed in the State and National Registers of Historic Places.

He suffered economic setbacks in his business and was found guilty of embezzling tax receipts and forging postal money orders. He was ultimately imprisoned after fleeing to Canada.

According to the Pennsylvania Chronicle and Universal Advertiser of August 8–15, 1768, classes were to be offered by Caleb Cooper of Nassau Hall (Princeton) in that autumn.\n\nThe school moved to its own building in New Brunswick with the opening of the college’s Queen’s Campus on Somerset Street in the early 19th century, at the corner of Somerset and College Avenue. The structure is now known as Alexander Johnston Hall and is used for various Rutgers news and publication services.\n\nThe school retained its association with Rutgers University until 1958, when it separated from the college and moved to its present site in Franklin Township on the former Wells Estate. The property there had once been owned by the Rev. Abraham Beach, rector of Christ Episcopal Church in New Brunswick.
